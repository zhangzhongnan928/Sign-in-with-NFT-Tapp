# Architecture Design for Sign in with NFT

## Introduction

This architecture describes the decentralized authentication system based on **NFTs**. It allows users to sign in to websites using their wallets, with NFTs acting as the login credentials. It leverages blockchain technology (Ethereum or other EVM-compatible chains) and provides a seamless integration for websites with minimal back-end infrastructure.

## Components

### 1. **User Wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)**
   - **Function**: Acts as the primary user interface for signing transactions and interacting with the blockchain.
   - **Role**: The wallet is used to sign challenge messages and authenticate the ownership of an NFT that will serve as the login credential.
   - **Interaction**: 
     - Connect to the website via the SDK.
     - Sign a challenge from the website.
     - Allow the website to verify the ownership of the NFT.

### 2. **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)**
   - **Function**: Represents the user’s decentralized login credential.
   - **Standards**: Compatible with **ERC-721**, **ERC-1155**, **ERC-5169**, or **ERC-7738** (depending on whether the NFT is new or an existing token).
   - **Role**: The NFT is checked by the website to confirm if it satisfies the platform’s login requirements.
   - **Interaction**:
     - Stored in the user’s wallet.
     - Used to verify login credentials upon signing the challenge message.

### 3. **SDK (Sign in with NFT SDK)**
   - **Function**: Provides an easy-to-integrate JavaScript library for websites to implement the "Sign in with NFT" functionality.
   - **Role**: Handles wallet connection, challenge signing, and NFT ownership verification.
   - **Interaction**:
     - Initiates the wallet connection and requests the user to sign a challenge.
     - Passes the signed message to the back-end for verification.
     - Receives verification status and handles the login session on the website.

### 4. **Website (Front-End and Back-End)**
   - **Function**: The web application where users log in using NFTs.
   - **Front-End**:
     - Includes a "Sign in with NFT" button that integrates with the SDK.
     - Initiates the wallet connection and interacts with the SDK.
   - **Back-End**:
     - Generates a **challenge message** to be signed by the user’s wallet.
     - Verifies the signed message and checks whether the user owns the required NFT.
   - **Interaction**:
     - Sends the challenge message to the user’s wallet.
     - Verifies the signed message against the wallet’s public address.
     - Interacts with a blockchain node to check for NFT ownership.

### 5. **Blockchain Network (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)**
   - **Function**: Hosts the NFT contracts and stores the proof of ownership.
   - **Role**: Acts as the source of truth for verifying the ownership of the NFT used in login.
   - **Interaction**:
     - The website queries the blockchain to verify that the user’s wallet address owns the required NFT.

## Workflow

1. **User Initiates Login**: 
   - The user visits the website and clicks the "Sign in with NFT" button.
   
2. **Connect Wallet**: 
   - The website prompts the user to connect their wallet (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect).
   
3. **Challenge Generation**: 
   - The back-end of the website generates a unique challenge message that is sent to the user's wallet.

4. **User Signs the Challenge**: 
   - The user signs the challenge with their private key, proving that they control the wallet.

5. **Verify Signature**: 
   - The back-end verifies that the signed message corresponds to the public address of the user’s wallet.

6. **Check NFT Ownership**: 
   - The back-end queries the blockchain to ensure that the user’s wallet address owns the required NFT for authentication.

7. **Authentication Complete**: 
   - If the NFT ownership and signature are valid, the website logs the user in and starts a session.

## Key Interactions

### Wallet ↔ Front-End (SDK)
- **Purpose**: To request the user to connect their wallet and sign a challenge.
- **Method**: The SDK communicates with the wallet provider (e.g., MetaMask) to handle signing.

### Front-End ↔ Back-End
- **Purpose**: To send the signed challenge to the server and receive the verification response.
- **Method**: The front-end calls the back-end API to verify the signature and NFT ownership.

### Back-End ↔ Blockchain
- **Purpose**: To verify the ownership of the NFT associated with the user’s wallet.
- **Method**: The back-end queries the blockchain (via an Ethereum node or service like Infura) to verify the user’s NFT.

## Security Considerations

1. **Challenge Signing**: The challenge signed by the wallet ensures that only the wallet owner can authenticate. The challenge should include timestamps to avoid replay attacks.
  
2. **NFT Verification**: The verification process ensures that only wallets holding the required NFT can sign in, preventing unauthorized access.

3. **Decentralized Control**: The wallet and NFTs are fully decentralized, meaning the user has full control over their identity without relying on centralized authorities.

## Scalability and Future Considerations

- **Multi-Chain Support**: The system can be extended to work with multiple blockchains (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum, Base) as demand grows.
- **Customizable Logic**: Websites can set custom login conditions based on NFT attributes, making the solution flexible for a wide range of use cases (e.g., premium users based on rare NFTs).
- **TokenScript Integration**: Future versions can include **TokenScript** to create interactive tapps (mini-apps) within the NFT, offering a richer experience post-login.
