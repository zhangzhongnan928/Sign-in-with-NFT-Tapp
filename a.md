# Sign in with NFT - The Future of Decentralized Authentication

## Introduction

**Sign in with NFT** is an open-source solution that enables any website to implement decentralized user authentication using NFTs. Just like "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Facebook," this project provides a frictionless login experience but with **user-owned** credentials in the form of NFTs. This empowers users with privacy, true ownership, and decentralized identity across the web.

By adopting "Sign in with NFT," we aim to drive mass adoption of **Ethereum** and **web3 technologies**. It allows websites to seamlessly integrate decentralized login mechanisms while giving users control over their own identity and credentials.

## Features

- **NFT-based Authentication**: Websites can implement an easy and secure way for users to log in using their NFTs as credentials.
- **Universal Integration SDK**: A simple JavaScript SDK for any website to quickly add the "Sign in with NFT" functionality.
- **ERC-5169/ERC-7738 Integration**: Supports loading TokenScript for NFTs to act as tapps (portable mini-applications).
- **Multi-chain Support**: Initially supports Ethereum and Polygon, with plans to expand to other EVM-compatible chains.
- **Customizable Login Logic**: Websites can set login conditions based on specific NFT attributes or collections.
- **Fully Open-Source**: The project is a public good aimed at driving mass Ethereum adoption, with contributions welcome from developers worldwide.

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. **Connect Wallet**: Users click "Sign in with NFT" on a website and connect their wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.).
2. **Challenge Message**: The website backend generates a challenge message that is sent to the user for signing.
3. **Verify NFT Ownership**: After the user signs the message, the backend verifies that the user holds the required NFT and checks its validity (e.g., attributes, collection).
4. **Authentication**: Once verified, the user is authenticated and logged in to the website.

### Supported Chains
Currently, "Sign in with NFT" supports:
- Ethereum
- Base

More EVM-compatible chains like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base will be added based on community demand.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get started with integrating **Sign in with NFT**, you will need:
- A **MetaMask** wallet or other Ethereum-compatible wallets.
- Basic knowledge of **JavaScript** and **web3**.
- A web platform where you want to enable decentralized login.

### Installation
First, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sign-in-with-nft.git
cd sign-in-with-nft
npm install

Next, you can add the Sign in with NFT SDK to your website.

SDK Integration

To integrate “Sign in with NFT” on your website, follow these steps:

	1.	Install the SDK in your project:

npm install sign-in-with-nft-sdk


	2.	Add the following code to your login page:

import { connectWallet, signMessage, verifyNFT } from 'sign-in-with-nft-sdk';

// Triggered when the user clicks "Sign in with NFT"
async function signInWithNFT() {
  const wallet = await connectWallet();
  
  // Generate a challenge message
  const challenge = await fetch('/api/generate-challenge');
  
  // Sign the challenge message with the user's wallet
  const signature = await signMessage(wallet, challenge);
  
  // Verify the signed message and NFT ownership
  const isValid = await verifyNFT(wallet, signature);
  
  if (isValid) {
    // Successful login, redirect the user
    window.location.href = '/dashboard';
  } else {
    alert("Invalid NFT or login attempt failed.");
  }
}

	3.	Configure your backend to handle challenge message generation and NFT verification. (See the NFT Verification Backend section for more details.)

Example Code

Check the /examples directory for fully working integration examples.

NFT Verification Backend

To verify NFT ownership, you will need a backend that handles the challenge generation and NFT validation. Here’s a basic implementation:

	1.	Generate a Challenge: This API endpoint generates a challenge for the user to sign.

app.get('/api/generate-challenge', (req, res) => {
  const challenge = `Sign this message to authenticate: ${Date.now()}`;
  res.json({ challenge });
});

	2.	Verify Signature and NFT: This API endpoint verifies the signed message and checks NFT ownership.

app.post('/api/verify-nft', async (req, res) => {
  const { walletAddress, signature } = req.body;

  // Recover the signed message
  const signedMessage = web3.eth.accounts.recover(challenge, signature);
  if (signedMessage.toLowerCase() !== walletAddress.toLowerCase()) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid signature' });
  }

  // Check NFT ownership
  const contract = new web3.eth.Contract(ERC721_ABI, NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
  const owner = await contract.methods.ownerOf(TOKEN_ID).call();
  
  if (owner.toLowerCase() === walletAddress.toLowerCase()) {
    return res.json({ valid: true });
  } else {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'NFT not owned' });
  }
});

More advanced backend setups (e.g., multi-chain, custom logic for NFT attributes) can be added as necessary.
