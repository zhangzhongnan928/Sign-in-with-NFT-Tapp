## 1. Product Overview

"Sign in with NFT" is a decentralized authentication solution that allows users to sign in to websites using their NFTs as login credentials. The solution leverages Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains to verify NFT ownership and allows websites to adopt a secure, seamless, and user-owned login system.

This solution will be provided as an open-source SDK that any website can easily integrate into their front-end and back-end infrastructure, enabling crypto users to authenticate with their wallet and NFTs.

## 2. Target Audience

1. **Users (End-Users)**
   - Crypto enthusiasts and NFT holders.
   - Users of Web3 platforms looking for a decentralized login method.
   - Privacy-conscious users who want to control their own digital identity.

2. **Developers (Website Developers)**
   - Web2 and Web3 developers who want to integrate NFT-based login to onboard crypto users.
   - Platforms looking to increase engagement by offering NFT-based rewards and access.
   - E-commerce, content, and membership sites looking to simplify payments and authentication by linking wallets.

## 3. Key Objectives

- **Ease of Integration**: Developers should be able to integrate "Sign in with NFT" into their websites with minimal effort using a lightweight JavaScript SDK.
- **User Ownership**: Users should have full ownership of their login credentials via NFTs, with no need for centralized account management.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: The solution should initially support Ethereum and Polygon, with the ability to expand to other EVM chains in the future.
- **High Security**: The login process must ensure secure verification of NFT ownership and wallet signatures.
- **Customizability**: Developers should be able to customize login requirements based on specific NFT collections or attributes.

## 4. Core Features

1. **User Login with NFTs**
   - Users authenticate themselves using their wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect) and the NFTs they own.
   - The SDK will handle the wallet connection, signature generation, and verification.

2. **Customizable NFT Login Rules**
   - Websites can define the specific NFTs or collections that users must own to log in.
   - Optional customization based on NFT attributes (e.g., rare NFTs granting premium access).

3. **Wallet Connection**
   - Support for popular wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) to allow users to connect and sign in easily.
   - After the wallet connects, the user signs a challenge message proving they control the wallet.

4. **Backend NFT Verification**
   - The back-end verifies the signed message and NFT ownership by querying the blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.).
   - This ensures that only users holding the required NFT can sign in.

5. **Cross-Platform Integration**
   - The SDK should work across various types of websites, including e-commerce, membership, social platforms, and content platforms.

6. **Multi-Chain Support**
   - Initial support for Ethereum and Polygon, with a roadmap to expand to more chains like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Base.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### A. Front-End Requirements
- **SDK Integration**:
   - Provide a lightweight JavaScript SDK for developers to integrate the "Sign in with NFT" button on their websites.
   - The SDK should handle wallet connections, challenge generation, and interaction with the wallet provider (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.).
   
- **Wallet Interaction**:
   - Ensure seamless connection to wallets like MetaMask.
   - Handle errors gracefully if users fail to connect their wallet or sign the message.
   - Provide developers the ability to customize the UI for the wallet connection.

### B. Back-End Requirements
- **Challenge Message Generation**:
   - The back-end must generate a unique challenge message for the user to sign. This message should include a timestamp to prevent replay attacks.

- **Signature Verification**:
   - Verify the signed message from the wallet to ensure that it matches the public key of the user's address.

- **NFT Ownership Verification**:
   - Query the blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) to check if the wallet address holds the required NFT.
   - If the user owns the required NFT, proceed with authentication. If not, return an error message.

### C. Blockchain Interaction
- **Node Setup**:
   - Use an Ethereum node (Infura, Alchemy, or similar services) to interact with the blockchain and verify NFT ownership.

- **Cross-Chain Queries**:
   - Ensure compatibility with multiple chains to verify NFT ownership across different blockchains (starting with Ethereum and Polygon).

---

## 6. Success Metrics

- **Developer Adoption**: Measure the number of developers integrating the "Sign in with NFT" SDK into their websites.
- **User Engagement**: Track how many users successfully log in to websites using NFTs.
- **Wallet Compatibility**: Ensure seamless compatibility with popular wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet).
- **Security**: Ensure zero security breaches or vulnerabilities in the NFT ownership and login process.

## 7. User Stories

### As a User:
- I want to log in to websites using my wallet and NFT without needing to create a traditional account.
- I want to be able to control my identity through the NFTs I own and use different NFTs on different platforms.

### As a Website Developer:
- I want to easily integrate NFT-based login into my website using a simple SDK.
- I want to specify which NFTs users need to hold to access premium features or exclusive content.
